<h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>

<h5>When two players are connected</h5>
<p>The game starts and you dont know who you are but the other players knows and you know who the other player is so you will have to ask questions in the chat like "Is my hair long?" and the other player should answer yes or no and based on the answer you should click on the cards that dont match and discard them or you can click at the guess button and try to guess who you are</p>

<h5>3 guesses</h5>
